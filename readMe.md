Commute:  Live in Baltimore, Work at the NIH
========================================================

Looks like my commute to the NIH is more consistent than the ride home to Baltimore, and more fuel efficient too.  On the x-axis, 1 is Monday and 5 is Friday.  On the y-axis, duration in minutes.

Stray Observations:
 
 _The Slow Burn_ was a success!  I kept it 55 the whole way and broke the 45 MPG barrier with 48.7.  Next goal is 50 MPG.
